ISSUE ANALYSIS:

In the click event handler:
```javascript
minimap.addEventListener("click", function (e) {
    const minimapWidth = document.body.clientWidth * 0.2; // Recalculated here
    const scale = minimapWidth / document.body.scrollWidth; // Recalculated here
    // ... rest of the code
});
```

The problem is that when the window is resized:

1. The `updateContentScale()` function calculates a new scale:
   `const realScale = minimapWidth / document.body.scrollWidth;`
   
2. But in the click handler, you're recalculating the scale using current values:
   `const scale = minimapWidth / document.body.scrollWidth;`

3. However, the minimap content has already been transformed with the scale from `updateContentScale()`, 
   but the click handler doesn't account for this existing transformation.

4. Also, `document.body.scrollWidth` might have changed after resize, but the minimap content 
   dimensions were set based on the previous scroll dimensions.
